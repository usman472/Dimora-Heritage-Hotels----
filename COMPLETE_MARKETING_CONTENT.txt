TITLE:
Premium Italian Heritage Hotels Directory - Fully Built Affiliate Site with Real Properties & Revenue Strategy

DESCRIPTION:

This production-ready website showcases 15 real, premium Italian heritage hotels across Italy's most desirable regions: Tuscany, Amalfi Coast, Sicily, Venice, Puglia, and Florence. Every property is authentic, verified, and bookable through integrated Booking.com affiliate links.

The heritage hotel niche targets ultra-affluent travelers spending €280-450+ per night on average. With Booking.com affiliate commissions typically 25-40% of their commission (which is 15-25% of booking value), each conversion can generate €30-80 per booking. A single 3-night booking at €350/night could yield €40-60 in affiliate revenue. With consistent traffic, 20-40 monthly bookings could generate €800-2,400/month passive income.

The site includes complete responsive HTML/CSS design with Playfair Display headings and Poppins body text, 15 real heritage properties with Booking.com integration, high-quality Unsplash images (warm tones, vertical orientation), AdSense-ready ad placements (top leaderboard, sidebar, in-feed units), complete marketing package with social media captions and SEO keywords, and structured data JSON for easy expansion to 50-100 properties.

Revenue streams include Booking.com affiliate commissions (€30-80 per booking), Google AdSense (€0.50-1.00 RPM in luxury travel niche), direct hotel partnerships (5-8% commission vs 4% affiliate), and sponsored content opportunities (Italian tourism boards pay €500-2,000 per featured article). Conservative revenue projection: €195/month (Month 1) → €960/month (Month 3) → €1,920/month (Month 6) → €3,840/month (Month 12).

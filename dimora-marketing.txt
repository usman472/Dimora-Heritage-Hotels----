EMAIL 1 - SUBJECT: Welcome to Your Italian Heritage Journey ✨

Dear [Name],

Welcome to Dimora Heritage, where every stay is a journey through centuries of Italian history, artistry, and aristocratic elegance.

You've just discovered something special—a curated collection of Italy's most authentic heritage hotels. These aren't ordinary accommodations. They're 11th-century castles with Brunello vineyards. 16th-century palazzos with original Murano chandeliers. 17th-century monasteries perched above the Amalfi Coast.

Each property has been personally vetted for:
✓ Historical authenticity and significance
✓ Exceptional luxury and service standards
✓ Architectural and cultural value
✓ Unique character and storytelling

Whether you're planning an anniversary in Tuscany, a honeymoon on the Amalfi Coast, or simply seeking la dolce vita, you're in the right place.

Warmly,

EMAIL 2 - SUBJECT: 5 Secrets to Choosing Your Perfect Heritage Hotel 🏛️

[Name],

Not all heritage hotels are created equal. After years of slow travel through Italy, here's what we've learned:

1. **Look Beyond the Facade** - Original frescoes, antique furnishings, and Murano glass matter. Ask about authenticity.

2. **Private Spaces Are Gold** - Chapel, vineyard, beach, or terrace? Private amenities define luxury heritage stays.

3. **Location Tells the Story** - Val d'Orcia castles vs. Grand Canal palazzos vs. Amalfi cliffside monasteries—each offers a different narrative.

4. **Estate Size Matters** - A 300-acre organic estate (Borgo Santo Pietro) offers different experiences than a city palazzo (Relais Santa Croce).

5. **Michelin Matters Too** - Many heritage hotels have starred restaurants. Dine where you sleep for the full experience.

Our favorite? Castello di Velona for Val d'Orcia views, Palazzo Venart for Venetian romance, Monastero Santa Rosa for Amalfi drama.
